My professional portfolio containing my master's level research project. This master's thesis also contains a powerpoint presentation I conducted to showcase my research and findings.
My research explored the features of Snapchat as a social networking platform and how users' intereactions with the app shape their expectations around its usage. The findings offered insights into how individuals use Snapchat's different features, and how this can impact their real life relationships.
